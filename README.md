# Work-Day-Calender

About/Process:

For this challenge, we were tasked with creating a functional work-day calender using jquery and javascript elements, as well as being able to modify html. With the starter code we were given, there were several aspects misssing which limited the functionality of the calender. First we needed to expand the calender so it went all the way to 5pm. THe next task was to use jquery to add functionality. The first thing  I did was use a jquery function to wrap the entirity of the body in a function which would allow the page to load fully before the code was run. The next thing I did was add the current date and time using the DayJS function. after reviewing the format, it was as simple as adding the correct elements (hour, minutes, day, month, and year). The most dificult part of the jquery script for me, was adding functionality so the calender would store the added events into the local storage. After some tinkering with my id's and classes, I was able to figure it out though. Finally I needed to add a function that would assign the correct class to each time-slot based on the current time. I was able to achieve this by using "addClass" and "removeClass" functions. Overall, I feel pretty confident coming away from this challenge, even though I do not know jquery very well by heart, I was able to figure out many of the functionality aspects and end up with a responsive calender which uses local storage to save the users events.
